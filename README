Welcome to Ganeti OS Definitions!

This is my little contribution to the great GANETI project.

In a few words this package contain 2 OS definition to handle fully (KVM) virtualized Windows and Linux machines:
- linux-image -> definition to handle fully virtualized linux systems.
- raw-image -> definition to handle fully virtualized machines (such as windows).

There are some requirements to make these scripts to work:
1 - the hypervisor must be KVM
2 - the linux-images disks must have 2 partitions (root and swap)
3 - the disk template must be DRBD.

To use them you have to Install them in all your nodes under the "/srv/ganeti/os" directory and then Create your new instances.
